      <div class="carousel-inner">
        <div class="carousel-item container-fluid">
          <h2 class="testimonial-text">I wasn't in the proper shape that I wanted to be, being a dancer, because I'm a foodie and I had no motivation to workout. But once I had a ligament tear, I wanted to become fit and look the way I actually wanted to. That's when I came across karthikxfit page, actually I've known him before but after talking to him and getting to know his workout routines it made us really close and I would say I have got a brother for life. It's not just about the workouts or diets he gives, it's also about the consistent motivation that lot of trainers don't give. Individual care is something which is very important for people like me because without that motivation we would again go back to that shape we were in. So I'm really happy and I love the way I look. Definitely would recommend his coaching.</h2>

        <div class="carousel-item container-fluid">
          <h2 class="testimonial-text">Karthikxfit is one among the few hardworking and down to earth people I know. We are good friends that share the same interests and ideologies. We were workout buddies for a long time before I decided to get coaching from him. His knowledge when it comes to mind muscle connection, hypertrophy, progressive overload and nutrition are immaculate. His passion for fitness and transforming people's lives is crazy. He's the best one could ask for. So Book him asap!</h2>

        <div class="carousel-item active container-fluid">
          <h2 class="testimonial-text">The moment I met Karthik, the first thing that caught my eye was his chiseled physique (obviously), but the more I interacted with him I realized he was different. His passion for fitness (more importantly being all Natural) and the effort and hours he puts into it to gain knowledge is unparalleled. He looked like a man on a mission and that's when I decided he's going to be the one I'm going to train under. He constantly monitors your progress and alters the program accordingly. I've been working out for 5 years, but it was Karthik who helped me unlock new levels of strength with his trademark weighted compound strength cluster workouts. There is much more, but if you're looking for only one reason to train under Karthik, he's the best hype man you could ever get, so get him ASAP!!!</h2>

          <h2 class="testimonial-text">He did a great job by providing all the essential training and diet charts. Everyday he had a track of everything. I would say that he did justice to his job, and thanks to him for making me beleive in reducing my weight and changing my diet :)</h2>

          <h2 class="testimonial-text">First of all, I want to talk about his curiosity in understanding us and our body. He is very keen in understanding us to give the best workout routine and diet plan. 
            I liked the way he changed the routines based on our progress and he is also very flexible in terms of workout. But diet is a strict oneüòú

            I like his personalised training and the way he motivates me. Mainly, giving proper time to clients and explaining the importance of each exercise and food etc is excellent. What not, he was perfect in everything like providing right information, guidance, exercise routines and diet information. I wish to resume his service soon.</h2>
